Here, I am going to list all the steps to create a new file in the local directory, commit it in Git, and Push it to a repository in GitHub.

Step 1: In your local Git Main directory, create a .MD file. Use NotePad++ to edit the file.
Step 2: In your Git Bash, enter the following commands to commit and push the file.
		Once you make changes, it is a new file and it is unstaged. So first "Stage it" in order to save in local Git directory.
		Follow prompts to enter a message in the Commint_Edit message file. 
		Save and close it. 
		The new file is added.
		
		Next, commit the changes. 
		
		Next, push the changes to repository.
