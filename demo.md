This is the first time I am learning creating a file in NotePad++.


I am using MarkDown as my chosen Markup Language. This is the final fourth one! :)


I am using NotePad++ as my text editor.

I could successfully push a file to GitHub. Yay. Now, I am going to try to commit and push again. 

I hope the changes work! 


I am learning a new course on MarkDown. Yay! I'll get there. I'll reach my goal! That is it! :)
No more changes.
