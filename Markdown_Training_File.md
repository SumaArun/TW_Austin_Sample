# Paragraph Examples


This is my Paragraph example

This example will have a break but 
it will show on the same line. 

This includes a real hard  
break and therefore there is a  
break in the paragraph now. I gave  
two spaces after the words "a" and "gave".

Heading 1
=========

Heading 2
----------

# Also for header 1

## Also for header 2

### heading 3

#### heading 4

For exphasis - *italics*  
or you can use underscore _italics_

For bold __bold__  
Or **bold** 

For a word within a word, use *  
example **Samsung***Austin***Semiconductor**

## Using Quotations

> He also says, **Help Ever**, **Hurt Never**.

### Writing inline code and block code

* This is an inline code. Use `ls` to list the folders in Git.  
* For block code, give 4 intent spaces: 

        cd ~ 
        ls -l   

## This section is about lists - both ordered, unordered, and nested

This is an unordered list created using the * symbol:
* this is first 
* this is second
* this is third

This is an ordered list created using numbers:

1. We will first drive to Alburqueue
1. Then we will visit Sandia Peak
1. Next, we will visit White Sands National Park

This is about **nested lists**:

* Fruits

    * mango
    * Jackfruit
    * kiwi  


* Vegetables

    1. Cucumber
    2. Carrots
    3. Onions
